A 10-minutes example on how to get a simple Node.js app up and running.
In the end, you can point your Browser to the IP of your Pi and see a running webserver!

Based on: https://docs.docker.com/examples/nodejs_web_app/

## How to use in 3 steps
### Step 1: Build the image

On your Raspberry Pi you can clone this example with

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hypriot/rpi-node-example-hello-world.git
$ cd rpi-node-example-hello-world
```

Then build the Docker image with

```bash
$ docker build -t node-hello .
```

### Step 2: Run the container

Now run the container with

```bash
$ docker run -p 80:80 -d node-hello
```

### Step 3: Test it

On your computer open a web browser and type `http://localhost:80` or use `curl` to connect to your the hello world container on the Pi.

```bash
curl http://ip-of-your-raspberry-pi
```
